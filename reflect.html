    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in today’s world it becomes easy for us to get information from any website at any devices. It is all because we have been using design called Responsive design in our web pages which gives flexible web Pages for all kind of fonts, images, etc. It makes our website look user-friendly and attract more people. Main goal of creating this type of design is detecting visitor’s screen size and making changes to the layout accordingly.<br>    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes a job easy for web developer as we don’t have to mention different programs for different sizes. Most strange thing for me was that I was not aware that single line code can make a code easily accessible on every device. As a result, HTML code can be used instead of writing it again which saves a lot of time. It is the best approach that suggests that design of a WEB Page should respond according to the user’s behavior.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The web Page I have created used the code in which meta gives instructions to the browser to control web page’s dimension. I have used the viewpoint that allows user's visible area for a web Page. I have learnt that with more devices needs more screen resolution, definitions and new devices are made every other day and design made it possible for every device to handle size and function ability on even new devices.<br><br>
